Game Of Life 3D
=====

This is a personnal Python project to create a 3 dimensional "Game Of Life"
I can't really remember why I started it but I was probably bored during an algorithmics lesson at the time.

The final objective of this small project is for the user to be able to chose between Conway's original rules
and rules that they will be offered to set. They should also be able to see multiple generations and navigate
in a generation with only the console.

THIS MIGHT ONLY WORK USING THE CONSOLE SO IT MIGHT NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS
